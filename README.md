### `Personal Note`

#### react deploy through github

I added lines inside package.json â€”
"homepage" : "https://justin-jang.com",
and
"scripts": { "predeploy":"npm run build && cp CNAME build/CNAME", "deploy":"gh-pages -d build", }
to deploy react.js through gh-pages.

I also added CNAME including my url in order to gh-pages to automatically include my custom url when I **npm run deploy**.

#### react-router

I used **HashRouter** instead of BrowserRouter as an alternative prevention of blank **route** page when deployed through gh-pages.

Through the Switch, Route system, the page routes between "home" and "thankyou" page.

#### formsubmit.com

I used a third party site to send me emails through form submission on the contact section.
